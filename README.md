Workforce Attrition
## Problem Statement
The company is experiencing workforce attrition, with employees leaving due to resignations,
retirements, and involuntary terminations. HR needs to analyze key factors affecting employee
retention and workforce stability. By understanding trends in employee tenure, termination
reasons, performance ratings, and pay zones, HR can develop strategies to improve retention,
optimize staffing, and enhance employee satisfaction.
